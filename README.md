# Mini_Zerodha_Dashboard

Mini Zerodha Dashboard is a simplified front-end clone of the Zerodha trading platform, built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — without any backend.
It simulates the experience of viewing live stocks, managing a personal watchlist, and performing mock trading interactions through a clean and interactive dashboard UI.

The project demonstrates frontend logic, local storage management, and dynamic JSON data handling — making it a great portfolio project for beginners learning web development and data-driven UI design.

## Mini Zerodha Dashboard Webpages snaps


## 💡 Key Features

🏠 Home Page — Introduction with navigation links (Home, Register, Login).

📝 Register Page — Allows users to create an account. User data is stored securely in Local Storage.

🔐 Login Page — Verifies registered users and creates a session for login using Session Storage.

📊 User Dashboard —

Fetches and displays stock data from a dummy JSON file (data.json).

Includes an “Add to Watchlist” button for each stock.

👀 Watchlist Page — Displays stocks the user has added, retrieved from Local Storage.

🚪 Logout Feature — Ends the session and redirects the user back to the login page.


## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

DOM Manipulation

JSON Fetching using fetch() API

Local & Session Storage handling

Dynamic content rendering

Simple user authentication (frontend-only)

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

Integrate real-time stock APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Twelve Data).

Add portfolio value and profit/loss calculation.

Implement dark/light mode toggle.

Add chart visualization using Chart.js.

## 🚀 Outcome

This project gives a practical understanding of:

How trading dashboards like Zerodha display and manage stock data

Building a multi-page app purely using frontend technologies

Storing and managing user data locally without a backend
